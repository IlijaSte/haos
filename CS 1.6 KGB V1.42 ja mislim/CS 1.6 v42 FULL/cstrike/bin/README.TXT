If you see this file, there is a serious vulnerability in your Counter-Strike client.
Your client doesn't filter file types downloaded from server, which can be used to make serious damage to your computer and data.
Also, your client doesn't filter commands sent from server to be executed in the console, which can also be used to cause damage.

Purpose of TrackerUI is to fix these vulnerabilities, preventing their exploitation in the future.
You can check 'history.log' if fix was successfull.
If TrackerUI caused any disfunctionality of your Counter-Strike client we're sorry for the inconvenience.
